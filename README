This repository contains code for coarse-grained models of DNA that are based 
on the LAMMPS code. 

The oxDNA source code is located in /trunk/oxdna/src. Please copy all files into 
your LAMMPS /src directory and compile as normal. A template input file is 
contained in /trunk/oxdna/util together with initialisation data for a small
DNA duplex.

Further details can be found in a technical report in /trunk/oxdna/doc.

We apologize for the brevity of these instructions. We are currently in the
process of releasing the oxDNA implementation as a LAMMPS USER-package, which
will include a full documentation of the oxDNA model and its parametrization.
