What each file is :

add_linking.cc			c++ program for adding supercoils to a loop of 
				DNA. Reads in a lammps input data file. Writes 
				a lammps input data file.

measure_linking_loop.cc    	c++ program to measure the supercoiling (twist 
				and writhe). The writhe calculation is based on 
				Klenin and Langowski Biopolymers 54 (2000), and 
				should be exact. The twist calculation is only 
				approximate - could be improved by following 
				the twist calculation in 
				Clauvelin et al JCTC (2012), but that hasn't 
				been implemented yet.
