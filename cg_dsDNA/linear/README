The initial configuration here, is the one for the linear dsDNA model without phosphates, 1000 bp long, with its axis pointing along the positive z-direction (starting from z=0).
In this file:

    1.-Each nucleotide is represented by a rigid body with two interaction sites, so in total there are 4000 particles (2000 per single stranded DNA).
    2.-The first 2000 particles correspond to the patchy beads in the first strand:
	a)Odd indices represent the "bead" interaction sites.
	b)Even indices represent the "patch" interaction sites.
    3.-Since a nucleotide is made by two particles. There are 1000 molecules (rigid bodies) per ssDNA. 
       For example, particles 1 and 2 are part of the same molecule: 1.
    4.-The type of particles in the first strand:
	a)All the patches are type 2.
	b)Every interactive bead (type 1) is followed by two ghost beads (type 5).
    5.-The complementary ssDNA (last 2000 particles) are arrange in a similar way to the first ssDNA:
	a)Odd indices represent the "bead" interaction sites.
	b)Even indices represent the "patch" interaction sites.
	c)All the patches are type 4.
	d)Every interactive bead (type 3) is followed by two ghost beads (type 6).

The type of interactions are explained in detail in our paper. These are summarized here:
    1.-Backbone: set by fene bonds(type 1) between consecutive beads in the same strand.
    2.-Hydrogen Bonds: set by a harmonic/shift/cut bond(type 2) between complementary patches.
    3.-Stacking interaction: set by a morse potential that is implemented in lammps by a bond (type 3).

    4.-Kratkyâ€“Porod potential: set by a cosine angle (type 1).
    5.-Roll interaction: set by a harmonic angle (type 2).

    6.-Dihedral for the right-handedness of the chain (type 1).
