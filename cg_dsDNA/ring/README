The initial configuration is a dsDNA ring 1000 bp long, lying on the x-y plane and with its centre at the origin. Note that in order to have a supercolied dsDNA, you have to set the number of turns different from the natural number of turns (given by Nbp/10). If for example you have a circular dsDNA made by 1000 bp, the relaxed number of helical turns would be roughly 1000/10 = 100. So if you set the number of helical turns in the initial configuration different to 100, and you let the system to equilibrate, you will end up with a supercoiled ring (positive supercoiled if Turns>100 and negative supercoiled if Turns<100). The configuration provided here is initialized with 90 helical turns (negative supercoiled).

Please note that the lammps script for the ringDNA is basically the same as the one for the linearDNA, but the angle section is especified in a different way. This is just because the angle types are inverted in the initial configuration.

   For the linear chain we use:   angle_style hybrid harmonic cosine
                                  angle_coeff 1 cosine 52.0         
                                  angle_coeff 2 harmonic 200.0 90

   For the circular chain we use: angle_style hybrid harmonic cosine
                                  angle_coeff 1 harmonic 200.0 90    
                                  angle_coeff 2 cosine 52.0
