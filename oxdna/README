This repository contains code of several coarse-grained models of DNA that are 
based on the LAMMPS code.

The LAMMPS implementation of the oxDNA model is located in /cgdna/oxdna/src. 
Please cite [1] and the relevant oxDNA articles in any publication that uses 
this package.
 
To compile please copy all files into your LAMMPS /src directory and compile as
usual. A template input file is contained in /cgdna/oxdna/util together with 
initialisation data for a small DNA duplex.

More information and further details can be found in [1] or the preprint [2], 
which is also in /cgdna/oxdna/doc.

This package is as well distributed as LAMMPS USER-package and available from
the central LAMMPS web site at Sandia National Laboratories at 
http://lammps.sandia.gov
